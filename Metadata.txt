METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: Linux operating system, C compiler and NETCDF library were used to build the modified EMS applications on AIMS HPC. The EMS version used is 1.2.1.
                                                               The modified EMS was derived from the eReefs model (https://ereefs.org.au/ereefs) and the model descriptions are found in Baird et al. (2020). 
                                                               
Methods for processing the data: Hydrodynamic model forcing available in https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/models-about/models-hydrodynamics/
                                 Biogeochemical (BGC) model forcing: Simulated hydrodynamic model output; 
                                                                     Regional wave model data;
                                                                     2019 catchment conditions of nutrient and sediment loads available in https://svnserv.csiro.au/svn/CEM/projects/eReefs/model/gbr4_bgc_hindcast/gbr4_H2p0_B3p2_Cb/
                                 Initialisation file: GBR4 BGC 3p1 initialisation data
                                 The 4km resolution grid of the EMS was run on AIMS HPC from 1/12/2010 to 30/11/2012

Software-specific information needed to interpret the data: R Software version 3.5.1;  
                                                            GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version 6.1.0;
                                                            network Common Data Form (NetCDF-cxx) version 4.2.1; 
                                                            Open Message Passing Interface (OpenMPI-gcc) version 1.10.2; 
                                                            NetCDF Operators (NCO) version 4.5.5
